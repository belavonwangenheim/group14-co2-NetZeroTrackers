# Group14 – CO2 NetZero Trackers

This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions with the aim of evaluating progress toward net-zero targets by 2075. The analysis focuses on G7 countries, selected key EU member states, and other major contributors to global emissions. By examining historical trends, forecasting future developments, and identifying the most relevant sources of CO₂, the project aims to assess whether current trajectories align with international climate goals – and what actions may be necessary to close potential emission gaps.
